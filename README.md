lego harmonic analyzer

# 1.What kinds of things do you make?

I made a Lego machine that presentation Fourier Transformation in a high visual way. This lego machine replicates a harmonic analyzer designed in the late nineenth century by the physician Albert Michelson.
It must be noted that I referred to the video of YouTuber @thoroughfareproduction who created a 5-element analyzer. I redesigned the gearbox to increase the number of elements to 7, and made my own improvements in the design of sinusoid generator gear set to make the operation smoother.

# 2.How would you characterize / categorize what you make?

Lego machine, Fourier Transformation, Sinusoid, 3D models, Visual Learning

# 3.Briefly describe your portfolio of work

A harmonic analyzer can carry out two related tasks: it can add together weighted sines or cosines to produce a function graph, and it can perform the inverse operation of decomposing a given function graph into its constituent sinusoids. The addition of sinusoids is called Fourier synthesis and the inverse operation is called Fourier Analysis.
This type of machine is an analog computer that directly processes function graph without the digital computer which is almost considered essential by people today. It does not require electricity and can be operated by hand.
The capability of harmonic analyzer depends on the number of elements. I tried to increase the number of elements to 7, while Albert Michelson's copper analyzer once achieved 80 elements.

## Example of fourier analysis

Taking Fourier synthesis (5 sinusoids elelemnt) as an example,

![sinusoid function graph of computer](https://github.com/jadongao/legoanalyzer/blob/main/computer%20function%20graph.jpg)

where an is -1,+1, -1,+1, -1

F (x)= -sin(x)+sin(2x)-sin(3x)+sin(4x)-sin(5x)

Using this Lego harmonic analyzer, the actual output function graph is as follows, which is very close to the graph drawn by the computer.

## Parts of analyzer
This lego machine consists of the following parts:

### 3.1 Frequency generator
Frequency generator is a gearbox with 7 output shafts of different frequencies. The rotational speeds on the 7 axes are 1x, 2x, 3x, 4x, 5x, 6x, and 7x, respectively.
### 3.2 Sinusoid generator
The sinusoid generator is driven by 7  gears to drive Rocker arms, converting the circular rotation generated by the Frequency generator into sinusoidal motion. They are sin (1x), sin (2x), sin (3x), sin (4x), sin (5x), sin (6x), sin (7x)
This combination of mechanical elements produces the seven different sinusoidal waves: sin (1x), sin (2x), sin (3x), sin (4x), sin (5x), sin (6x), sin (7x)

### 3.3 Ample bars, weight the sinoids
There are 7 sinusoidal motions weighted, namely a1 * sin (1x), a2 * sin (2x), a3 * sin (3x), a4 * sin (4x), a5 * sin (5x), a6 * sin (6x), a7 * sin (7x)
### 3.4 Summing lever
Summming lever at the top of the machine adds together the weighted sinoids
The Fourier Synthesis operation is completed by adding up all the weighted sinoids.
### 3.5 Platen and Plumb
The platen moves horizontally and plumb moves vertically. and the pen tied to plumb draws a function graph of the calculation result on the recording paper.

# 4.How do you make?

Starting from March 2022, I built a Lego Machine using LEGO, which can be used for Fourier transformation
The entire process took quite a long time and spent a lot of time trying to complete each component

Sinusoid generator and Frequency generator are two key factors

### The Frequency generator
The Frequency generator is a gearbox, and I am amazed by the clever design of Youtuber @ thoroughfareproduction. But because YouTuber only provided videos without detailed installation drawings, I couldn't see his internal design and had to explore it myself. I first completed a 5-axis gearbox like YouTube, and after completing it, my confidence doubled. I challenged and completed a 7-axis gearbox.

Using almost all types of gears: 8 tooth, 12, 16, 20, 24, 28, 36, and also using chain transmission. Since I don't have such a complete range of gear types at home, I also used a 3D printer to temporarily print several types. Later, the 3D printed parts were replaced with purchased LEGO parts, which made the operation more stable. This method of testing before formal procurement greatly improves production efficiency, eliminating the need to wait for several days to receive LEGO parts before testing.

### The Sinusoid generator
The Sinusoid generator uses Lego worm gear to transmit circumferential rotation, but during the manufacturing process, there was a problem. Due to the loose gears and the fixed position of the worm, the worm would get stuck during operation, and the entire device could not operate at that time. I was forced to let go of this until a few months later when I had time to conduct a large number of repeated experiments and finally found a solution. The final method found is very simple, which is to make the worm position loose to avoid jamming. But in order to find this method, a large number of repeated disassembly and assembly were carried out.
The device that drives the LEGO beam to form sinusoidal motion is crucial. Youtubr @ thoroughfareproduction used a very simple bolt connection, but due to the need for rotation, a smooth bolt connection was used, which caused the gears and beam to shake easily. I believe this will cause significant errors, so I made improvements. Here, a 3D print model and bearings are used, and it is no longer a classic Lego work.

# 5.Why do you make?

When learning sound waves, I came across the idea that chords are composed of different combinations of sounds, and using Fourier Transformation, chords can be decomposed into the frequencies of their constituent sounds. I am very interested in Fourier Transformation, and I saw videos online from Professor Bill Hammack and YouTuber @ thoroughfareproduction, both dedicated to visualizing complex mathematical concepts in Fourier Transformation. So I decided to learn from them and make a Lego machine myself.
When making this Lego machine, I also traced the history of Fourier Transformation. I had a chance to communicate with these masters during this production process, and I felt their imaginative ideas in the era without electronic computers.



# 6.What's the most meaningful thing you've made?

It is worth mentioning that I strongly agree with visual learning through visualization. During my time as a tutor in a school, I realized that visualization teaching methods allow students to see and touch the abstract concepts they have learned, bringing them (including myself) closer to abstract concepts.
This Lego machine can correspond one-to-one with mathematical formulas, which visualizes mathematical concepts and helps me understand them.
